### No Inheritance
If we were to use classes without inheritance for the following example the classes might look like this:


<pre class="file" data-filename="test.py" data-target="replace">
class grocery:
    description = ""
    price = 0.0
    weight = 0.0
    
class mineral:
    description = ""
    price = 0.0
    volume = 0.0
    
class newspaper:
    description = ""
    price = 0.0
    publisher = ""
</pre>
python test.py{{execute}}
