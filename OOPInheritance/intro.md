This is an example of using inheritance in your programs. Inheritance:

1. Represents Real Life Relationships well.
2. It allows us to reuse code - if we add a method or property to a Parent class it is usable in all child classes.
3. If a method or property exists in class A, it is inherited by all classes that derive from class A and their child classes.

Use the following example to practice programming with inheritance.
